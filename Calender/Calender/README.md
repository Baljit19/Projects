This code is a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) application built using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a brief description of the code:

Imports: The code imports necessary modules:

Tkinter for GUI functionalities.
PIL for handling images.
calendar for generating calendar data.
Main Window Configuration:

A root window (root) is created with a specific size (400x300) and title (Calendar).
Functions:

show(): This function retrieves the month and year selected by the user from spin boxes and displays the calendar for that month and year in a text widget.
clear(): Clears the content of the text widget.
exit(): Destroys (closes) the main window.
User Interface Components:

Image Display: An image (calendar.png) is displayed at the top of the window.
Spin Boxes:
A spin box for selecting the month (ranging from 1 to 12).
A spin box for selecting the year (ranging from 2020 to 3000).
Text Widget: A text widget (cal) is provided to display the calendar.
Buttons:
"Show": When clicked, it calls the show() function to display the calendar.
"Clear": Clears the displayed calendar using the clear() function.
"Exit": Closes the application using the exit() function.
Main Loop: The root.mainloop() call enters the Tkinter event loop, which keeps the GUI running and responsive to user interactions.

In summary, this code provides a graphical interface for users to select a month and year, display the corresponding calendar, clear the calendar display, and exit the application.
