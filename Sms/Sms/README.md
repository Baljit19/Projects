This code creates a GUI application using Tkinter for sending SMS messages using the Fast2SMS API. Here's a brief description of the code:

1. **Imports**: 
    - `Tkinter` for GUI functionalities.
    - `PIL` for handling images.
    - `requests` to make HTTP requests to the Fast2SMS API.
    - `messagebox` from Tkinter to display messages to the user.

2. **Main Window Configuration**: 
    - A root window (`root`) is created with a fixed size (`500x300`) and title (`Send SMS`). The window cannot be resized beyond these dimensions.

3. **Functions**:
    - `send_sms()`: This function is triggered when the "Send Message" button is clicked. It retrieves the phone number and message from the respective entry and text widgets. Then, it constructs an API request to the Fast2SMS service to send the SMS. Upon successful sending, a message box informs the user.

4. **User Interface Components**:
    - **Background Image**: A background image (`background.jpg`) is displayed across the window.
    - **Title Label**: A label displaying the title "Send SMS Using Python" is placed at the top.
    - **Phone Number Entry**: An entry widget (`phone_no`) allows the user to input the phone number.
    - **Message Text Area**: A text area (`message`) allows the user to input the SMS message.
    - **Send Button**: A button (`send`) triggers the `send_sms()` function when clicked to send the SMS.

5. **API Configuration**:
    - The URL for the Fast2SMS API is defined.
    - The API key (which should be obtained by signing up at Fast2SMS) is used for authentication.
    - The message details, including the sender ID, language, and route, are configured as parameters for the API request.

6. **Main Loop**: The `root.mainloop()` call enters the Tkinter event loop, ensuring the GUI remains responsive to user interactions.

In summary, this code provides a graphical interface for users to enter a phone number and a message, then sends the SMS using the Fast2SMS API when prompted.
